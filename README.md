Blockchain Land Registration System

This project is a Blockchain-based Land Registration System designed to make land ownership records secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. By leveraging blockchain technology, all land transactions (registration, transfers, and ownership history) are stored in an immutable chain of blocks, ensuring trust and eliminating fraud.

Features

Register a new parcel

Add a new land parcel to the blockchain.

Each parcel is assigned a unique ID and owner details are stored.

Transfer parcel ownership

Ownership of a registered parcel can be transferred to another user.

A transfer transaction is recorded on the blockchain.

Mine pending transactions

Pending transactions (registrations or ownership transfers) are bundled into a block.

Mining confirms and secures these transactions into the blockchain.

View parcel owner

Check the current owner of a land parcel.

Ensures transparency in ownership verification.

View parcel history

Retrieve the entire ownership history of a parcel.

Shows how ownership has changed over time.

Validate blockchain

Verifies the integrity of the blockchain.

Ensures no block has been tampered with, maintaining trust in the system.

Why Blockchain for Land Registration?

Tamper-proof records: Once stored, ownership cannot be altered.

Transparency: All stakeholders can verify land history.

Trustless system: No single authority controls the data.

Security: Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity.

Future Enhancements

Integration with a web-based interface for easy use.

Smart contracts for automated ownership transfer.

Government/authority node participation for more robust validation.
